<h3>Servo Hand</h3>

<p>A servo is a type of motor that we can use to make precise movements back and forth. In this project we will use a servo motor to make an automatic waving machine!</p>

In addition to the usual parts, for this project you will need:
<ul class="checklist">
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/169" target="_blank">Servo motor</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/758" target="_blank">Jumper wires</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For this project you will need to make a cut out of your hand. Be sure to decorate it or include some sort of unique message.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tape your hand cutout to the end of the servo motor. Make sure the servo motor will still be able to move freely with your hand taped on.

  </li>
  <li>Wire up the servo motor to the Arduino using the circuit diagram below. You will need to use jumper wires to go between the servo motor and the Arduino pins.

  </li>
  <li>We can use the following code to make the servo motor swing back and forth. The servo only accepts values between 0 and 180 degrees.</li>
  <li>Click the green flag and see if you hand starts waving!

  </li>
  <li>Now see how you can make the wave better.<br />
    <strong>Can you:</strong>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Reduce the distance that the hand waves back and forth?</li>
      <li>Figure out a way to slow down the hand wave?</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Record a message and play it along with the hand wave?</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Incorporate the light sensor circuit and only wave when it gets light or dark?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
