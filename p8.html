<h3>Self-designed Project</h3>

<p>Now it's your time to get creative and design your own project!</p>

Your goal:
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>Incorporate all of the skills that we praticed in the guide (LEDs, light sensor, servo motor).</li>
  <li>Create instructions for someone else to try out your projects</li>
  <li>Make sure your project incorporates arts and crafts materials. Recycled materials like cups, boxes, and paper tubes make excellent Arduino parts!</li>
  <li>Create a short video demonstrating your creation.</li>
  <li>Take a moment to reflect on all of the awesome skills you have learned and about the many ways you can use them going forward!</li>
</ul>
